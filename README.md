# PerfectND - The Perfect Natural Dryer
This repository contains the project "PerfectND": a presentation and the scripts used to develop our first approach to the prototype of our product. The product is a tool to improve citizents quality of life through an optimized methodology to select the moment and amount of time to leave the clothes drying to avoid bad smells.

In this first approach we measure the temperature, humidity and pressure in the enviorment where the clothes are placed. With this measures the model detects when the clothes are already dry and when they start smelling bad due to exposure in city air. 

The script used for this purpose is \textit{perfectND.py}.

In order to see the Shiny presentation it is required to have installed plotly for R (install.packages("plotly")). 
Required Ubuntu libraries to install plotly: 
- libgdal-dev
